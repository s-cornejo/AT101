        <h3>GOAL:</h3>
        <p>create a function where the user can create geometric figures by clicking where they want the lines to be. It starts off by asking for two clicks where the first line will be drawn. Then, the next click will create the other line using the previous mouse click to connect the lines.</p>
        <h3>ACCOMPLISHED:</h3>
        <p>various lines are created wherever the mouse of the user is, and they're connected to an initial point at the center of the canvas. Once the user clicks anywhere on the canvas, a new initial point is created and lines will be drawn wherever the user drags their mouse connected to wherever was clicked.</p>
        <h3>Next Steps:</h3>
        <p>be able to stick with the intial goal of being able to draw a single line instead of multiple at a time so that the user has more control. The program seems to be working the way I intended, but it says I am using the xVar and yVar "out of scope", and I'm not sure what that means or how to fix that.</p>
